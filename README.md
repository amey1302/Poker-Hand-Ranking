# Poke-Hand-Ranking-Extension
# Problem Statement 
Change the poker program to include following new hand rankings:

Straight flush: All cards in the same suit, and in sequence
Two pair: Two pairs of cards have the same rank
The new hand rankings are:
Straight flush: All cards in the same suit, and in sequence
Four of a kind: Four of the cards have the same rank
Full House: Three cards of one rank, the other two of another rank
Flush: All cards in the same suit
Straight: All cards in sequence (aces can be high or low, but not both at once)
Three of a kind: Three of the cards have the same rank
Two pair: Two pairs of cards have the same rank
Pair: Two cards have the same rank
High card: None of the above conditions are met.
Modification:
High card rule should return the highest card as well,
Example ["S2" "D5" "C7" "ST" "HA"] should return, "high-card-ace"
